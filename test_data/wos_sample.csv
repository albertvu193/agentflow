"The Impact of Board Diversity on Corporate ESG Performance","Smith J.; Johnson K.","This study examines how board composition diversity affects environmental, social, and governance (ESG) outcomes in Fortune 500 companies. Using panel data from 2010-2020, we find that gender diversity on boards positively correlates with ESG scores, particularly in the environmental dimension. The relationship is moderated by firm size and industry type.","Journal of Corporate Finance",2023,"10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2023.001","WoS"
"Corporate Governance Mechanisms and Firm Environmental Performance: A Meta-Analysis","Lee H.; Wang M.; Chen L.","We conduct a meta-analysis of 85 empirical studies examining the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and environmental performance. Our findings indicate that board independence and audit committee effectiveness are the strongest predictors of environmental performance. We identify several moderating variables including country-level institutions and industry regulations.","Academy of Management Review",2022,"10.5465/amr.2022.0123","WoS"
"Executive Compensation and ESG Risk Management","Davis R.; Brown T.","This paper investigates how executive compensation structures influence ESG risk management practices. Using a sample of 1200 firms across 15 countries, we demonstrate that linking CEO pay to ESG metrics significantly reduces environmental incidents and improves social responsibility scores. The effect is stronger in firms with concentrated ownership.","Strategic Management Journal",2023,"10.1002/smj.3456","WoS"
